# arduino-light-controller

This is an old Arduino project I made to control an array of lights. The program can be used with a computer to accept specific commands, or with just a button. If the button is pressed, the program will select random animations and play them.

## Commands
- PREP: turn off all lights
- PRE\[1-9\]: play a predefined animation
- AUTO: play random animations
- L\[0-7\]=\[0/1\]: turn a light on or off
